#line 1 "text"
Here is some ordinary text with embedded Haskell-ish constructs,
that should however /not/ be interpreted as Haskell if the --text
option is given to cpphs.  For instance, here is a Haskell comment
including a cpp definition: {-
#  define FOO bar
and now we end the comment: -}   and try out the definition:  FOO
Likewise, double and single quotes no longer delimit strings or chars: "
#  define BAZ FOO
and what do we have here?: "  ' BAZ  '


Also, in text-mode, macros should be expanded inside Haskell comments:
    -- expand(this,other,that)
and strings "expand(this,other,that)".
